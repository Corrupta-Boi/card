## Documentation

This project was made using html and css to create a buisness card around a personal brand identity. The project is attempting to deliver the experiencing us how to program a website using html and css. I did this by designing and eventually redesigning my background and assets before importing images into VSC and messing with them from there.
Throughout the assignment I was able to learn how to code for the first time and to say it was a experience was a understatment. I made plenty of mistake from reocurring issues to codes messing with each other to many many more issues.
