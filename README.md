## What is the project you are attempting to deliver?
This project was made using html and css to create a business card around a personal brand identity. The project is attempting to deliver the experiencing us how to program a website using html and css. I did this by designing and eventually redesigning my background and assets before importing images into VSC and messing with them from there.

## What did you learn?
Throughout the assignment I was able to learn how to code for the first time and to say it was a experience was a understatement. I made plenty of mistake from reoccurring issues to codes messing with each other to many many more issues.

## How did you create your mock-uos
When It came to creating my high fidelity mock up I used the program Adobe Illustrator to create my original background design and also used it to remake my background design to be more user friendly. When it came to making my background I used a lot of references and inspiration from my mood board on pintrest. This allowed mr to design these backgrounds this this sorta high tech theme to the background. I also used Illustrator to design my logo that is used on my high fidelity mockup.

## Was this your first web page
In the end this was not my first website I have made in my life but it was the first time I used HTML and CSS to create a website. The first time I made a website I used a site was a lot simpler and user friendly then using code but it was a lot more limiting to say the least.
